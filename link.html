    <p>When Nick Vujicic was born, he had neither any arms nor any legs. Yes, he suffered from tetra-amelia syndrome which is a rare disorder. Not the best start to the journey called life, it has to be said.</p>
    <p>At the age of 10, he tried to take his own life. He was bullied at school and struggled mentally, emotionally, and physically. But he then decided to turn things around. Nick came to terms with his disability and decided to inspire others not to be grounded by their limitations.</p>
    <p>So what did he do? The man trained hard, became a swimmer, skydiver and surfer. He has competed in various parts of the world and his speeches are still inspiring people .</p>
    <p>Able-bodied sportspersons struggle to be good at one sport, this man is good at three. The lack of any limbs has had no effect on him and he is still moving forward.</p>
    <p>The man is happily married and has two sons. Nick remains an inspiration to people and proves that a disability does not limit a person.</p>

       <p> We could all learn something from him. Never give up is the lesson from his life we can take away. </p>
